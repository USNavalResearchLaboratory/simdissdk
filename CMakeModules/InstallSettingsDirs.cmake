# InstallSettingsDirs
# -------------------
#
# Define VSI-based standard installation directories.
#
# Provides install directory variables as defined by the requirements of the
# default SIMDIS installation paths in the SIMDIS build tree.
#
# Result Variables
# ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
#
# Inclusion of this module defines the following cache variables:
#
# ``INSTALLSETTINGS_RUNTIME_DIR``
#
# Destination for executables including DLLs on Windows systems.  The path is relative to the
# ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.
#
# ``INSTALLSETTINGS_LIBRARY_DIR``
#
# Destination for libraries including SOs on Linux systems.  The path is relative to the
# ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.
#
# ``INSTALLSETTINGS_PLUGIN_DIR``
#
# Destination specifically for SIMDIS Plug-ins, identified as shared objects built with the
# ``IS_PLUGIN`` target property set to ``1``.  The path is relative to the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.
#
# ``INSTALLSETTINGS_CMAKE_DIR``
#
# Destination for CMake configuration modules for installed libraries.  The path is relative to
# the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.
#
# ``INSTALLSETTINGS_INCLUDE_DIR``
#
# Destination for include files for installed libraries.  The path is relative to the
# ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.
#
# The module also defines the following non-cache helper variables:
#
# ``INSTALLSETTINGS_SHARED_LIBRARY_DIR``
#
# Destination for shared libraries.  On Windows systems, this is the same as the
# ``INSTALLSETTINGS_RUNTIME_DIR`` where dynamic link libraries (DLLs) are placed.  On Linux systems,
# this is the same as ``INSTALLSETTINGS_LIBRARY_DIR`` where shared objects (SOs) are placed.
#
# ``INSTALLSETTINGS_EXTENSION_DIR``
#
# Destination specifically for SIMDIS extensions.  The path is relative under the
# ``INSTALLSETTINGS_SHARED_LIBRARY_DIR`` path.

# Form the HW-OS (amd64-nt, x86-nt, amd64-linux, etc)
