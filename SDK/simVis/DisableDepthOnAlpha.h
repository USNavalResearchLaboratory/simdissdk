* OpenGL 3.3 shader that disables depth writes when alpha values are below a certain threshold.

* portions in the model.  Sometimes the render bins won't be set up properly, or even if they are
* there could be some camera angles where depth testing just isn't right for the transparent portions.
* As a result, parts of the ocean or other models show through where they shouldn't, or don't show
* through when they should.  This class provides a shader that disables depth writes when the alpha
* value is below a certain threshold, which should help correctly draw these models.
