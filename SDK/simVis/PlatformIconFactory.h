/**
 * Factory for creating performance-optimized 2D icons for platforms.  2D icons can be rendered quickly in
 * OSG with minimal state changes, such that tens of thousands of icons can be rendered very cheaply during
 * the Draw phase, so long as their state changes are minimized.
 *
 * Icons created in this factory will not fit cleanly into the typical PlatformModelNode hierarchy, which
 * relies on creating a generic node path in order to fill all available Platform features.  This is instead
 * an alternate path that is less flexible, but offers dramatically improved performance.  The canApply()
 * method will return false if this class won't be able to implement requested features.
 *
 * To use, simply call getOrCreate() and use the returned node.  If it returns null, then use the old
 * slower hierarchy because the user has a feature request that can't be used in this path.  When the
 * returned node is no longer used, inform via notifyRemove() to clean up memory.
 *
 * This class handles dynamic scale and scaling.  It does not handle icon rotations, and it expects to
 * be encapsulated in a BillboardAutoTransform (managed externally) for correct icon orientations.
 *
 * A singleton is provided for convenience, since most access will want to access the same factory.
 *
 * This factory can only create and return 2-D images.
