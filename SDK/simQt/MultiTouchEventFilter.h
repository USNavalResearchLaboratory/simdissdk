 * Responsible for passing multi-touch events received from Qt, into the event queue
 * associated with a given graphics window. This is designed to be used with the
 * simQt::ViewWidget and its embedded GraphicsWindow.
 *
 * This filter will correctly forward raw touch messages into the OSG event queue.
 * It includes the ability to filter out sporadic mouse events on the window while
 * the touch capability is active, which can cause conflicting input data, e.g.
 * in osgEarth EarthManipulator processing.
 *
 * This filter also attempts to compensate for Qt widgets and touch. The Qt widget
 * should register for touch events with setAttribute(Qt::WA_AcceptTouchEvents),
 * and if it does not, the filter will get touch update and end events, but not
 * touch begin events. This filter corrects that behavior.
