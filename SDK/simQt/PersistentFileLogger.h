/**
 * Provides a mechanism for creating persistent log files.  Log files are kept persistently
 * on disk in the user's home directory (~/.config/ORGANIZATION on Linux, %LOCALAPPDATA%/ORGANIZATION
 * on Windows).  The subdirectory for log files is the QCoreApplication::organizationName().
 *
 * Logs are time stamped, and include the process ID for uniqueness.  In some cases, this
 * is not enough for uniqueness so a .1, .2, .3, etc. might be appended to the filename.
 *
 * Log files are cleaned up automatically based on a maximum file age, relative to the time
 * of the class instantiation.  The default time period for clean-up is 2 weeks.  Clean up
 * will only occur for logs matching the same prefix (set at construction time).  Files
 * are cleaned up on a call to clean().
 *
 * Multiple loggers can exist in the same process, with either the same or different
 * prefixes.  This means the class can be easily reused for different contexts (e.g. an
 * application log, an error log, and an audit log).
