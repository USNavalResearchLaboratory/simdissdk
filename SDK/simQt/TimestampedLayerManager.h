/**
 * TimestampedLayerManager allows for image layers which are shown or hidden depending on the current time.  Timed layers are created by
 * giving the layer a <time> property in the configuration file.  This property takes a UTC time reference as the layer's start time.
 * Timed layers can also specify a group name with the <time_group> option that takes a nonempty string as the group name.  Layers with
 * no group specified will be considered in the same group.  At most one layer from each group will be shown at a time.  This class watches the
 * map for any image layers that have a time configuration and the clock for time updates.  On time updates, it shows or hides the layers
 * it finds so that, for each group, only the layer with greatest time that is less than or equal to current time is shown.  No timed layers
 * are shown before the earliest layer's time. If image layers are set invisible by another class, this class will not set them visible.
