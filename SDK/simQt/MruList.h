 * MruList is a collection of most recently used items, associated with a QMenu.

 * recently used items (e.g. recent files).  There is a maximum size to the MRU,
 * and newly added files are always added to the top of the list.  Adding an item
 * that already exists will bump it to the top of the list.  When an item is selected
 * from the list, the MruList emits the fileSelected() signal.
 * Note that filenames added with relative paths will be resolved to full path in the MruList,
 * so all filenames returned in getters or emitted in signals will be full path
