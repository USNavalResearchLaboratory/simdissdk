 * Implementation of the advanced selection algorithm, sometimes referred to as the advanced
 * hooking algorithm (AHA), identified in U.S. Patent 5,757,358.  This algorithm was developed
 * in a Navy research laboratory and was patented, but can be used without restriction.
 *
 * This algorithm improves selection ability by allowing the mouse to select if it is close to
 * an item, dynamically adjusting the pickable range of the item relative to items around it.
 * This improves accuracy when the display is cluttered or when a target is obscured.
 *
 * This picker supports picking of only platforms and gates at this time.  The gate picking is
 * based off gate locator, which is at the centroid node.  Gate picking is disabled by default.
 * Use the setPickMask() method to change this behavior.
