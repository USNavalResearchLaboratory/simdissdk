/**
 * Memory Data Store's Generic Data slice implementation.  For the sake of simplicity and performance,
 * non-infinite generic data is not respected in MemoryGenericDataSlice.  Instead, the non-infinite
 * expiration time is converted to an infinite expiration time.
 *
 * The algorithm attempts to balance two opposite use cases.  The first use case is Generic Data with
 * repeating values and the second use case is Generic Data with non-repeating values.  The algorithm
 * places strings in a std::deque and uses indexes to represent the strings.   When a string is inserted,
 * the algorithm checks the std::deque to see if the string is a repeat.  If the string is a repeat,
 * the algorithm reuses the index.  If there is a lot of non-repeating values the std::deque could get
 * quite large and checking all the values could take a lot of time.  The algorithm kicks out after searching
 * the 5 nearest neighbors.  The early kick out has two advantages.  First, having many non-repeating values
 * does not drag the CPU down in a futile search for a match.   Second, it allows for data limiting when both
 * repeating and non-repeating values are intermingled.  After 5 non-repeating values are received the repeating
 * value will get a new index in the queue.  The older repeating value can be data limited out without adversely
 * affecting the indexes.   Without the kick out it would theoretically be possible to stall the data limiting
 * of the std::deque and have it grow without bound.
