   * Calculates the midpoint between two LLA coordinates.  Accounts properly for wrapping around the antimeridian (dateline).  Provides

   *   - Low resolution, simple average (accounting for dateline) that is good for determining a center position for a view that
   *     encompasses both points.  With this method, the parameter ordering matters, as the calculation considers a west-to-east
   *     ordering on parameters.  In the event that parameters are not west-to-east, the algorithm presumes a whole-earth swath.
   *   - High resolution based on the Sodano method that accounts for the curvature of the earth.  More appropriate for calculations
   *     requiring a midpoint along the shortest line between two points.  Because this method uses the Sodano method, it picks the
   *     shortest path between points.  The high resolution version will never give a midpoint further than quarter of the
   *     circumference of the earth away.
   * @param[in ] llaBgnPos Geodetic (radians, radians, meters) position of the start coordinate; considered left and below the llaEndPos.
   *   If the longitude is greater than llaEndPos, then the area is considered to wrap the antimeridian (dateline).
   * @param[in ] llaEndPos Geodetic (radians, radians, meters) position of the start coordinate; considered right and above the llaBgnPos.
   *   If the longitude is less than that of llaBgnPos, then the area is considered to wrap the antimeridian (dateline).
   * @param[in ] highResolution If true, a high resolution calculation is performed to calculate the midpoint, which is more expensive.  If
   *   false, the average of the positions is taken (accounting for the antimeridian), which is faster.  The high resolution version will use
   *   a great circle method, which is best for calculating the midpoint along the path between the two points, but unsuitable for determining
   *   (for example) the optimum center position for fitting both points in a 3D view.
   * @param[out] midpoint Geodetic center position calculated by averaging the geodetic values.  The altitude is given as the average of the input
   *   altitudes and will not cut through the earth (unless one or more input values is below 0.0 altitude).
